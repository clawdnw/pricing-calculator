  Conversion-focused copywriting frameworks, headline formulas, CTA patterns, and sales copy templates.
  Use when: writing marketing copy, service offers, landing pages, outreach emails, Reddit posts, or any customer-facing text.
  Don't use when: writing internal docs, code comments, or technical documentation.
  Don't use when: generating the HTML/CSS of a landing page (use landing-page-generator for structure, this skill for the words).
  Output: Clear, direct copy that converts — headlines, CTAs, email templates, Reddit posts.
  Anti-patterns: Corporate jargon, vague promises, feature dumps without benefits, walls of text.

## Core Philosophy: Direct, No-Fluff, Operator Voice

**Brand Voice (NW Global Enterprise):**
- Direct and confident. No hedging ("we think," "maybe," "arguably")
- Short sentences. Punchy. Readable.
- Speak to outcomes, not features
- Active voice. "We build systems" not "Systems are built by us"
- No corporate jargon ("synergy," "leverage," "paradigm shift")
- First-person plural for company ("We deliver") or second person for reader ("You get")

**The Golden Rule:** If a prospect has to re-read a sentence, you failed. Clarity over cleverness. Always.

## Headline Formulas

### The 4-U Formula (Michael Masterson)
Every strong headline hits at least 3 of these:

| U | Question | Example |
|---|----------|---------|
| **Useful** | Does it solve a problem? | "Cut your cloud costs by 40%" |
| **Unique** | Is it different from competitors? | "The only invoicing tool built for freelancers" |
| **Urgent** | Does it create time pressure? | "Book before Friday for 50% off" |
| **Ultra-specific** | Does it include concrete details? | "Add 2,347 email subscribers in 30 days" |

### Top-Performing Headline Formulas

**1. Quantity Headline**
```
[Numeral] + [Noun] + [Verb] + [Outcome]
```
Examples:
- "500+ businesses switched to us this year"
- "Join 10,000+ marketers getting our weekly insights"

**2. Timed Headline**
```
[Do something hard] in [Time period]
```
Examples:
- "Launch your website in 48 hours"
- "Go from idea to paying customers in 14 days"

**3. Desired Outcome Headline**
```
[Desired outcome] by [How to get it]
```
Examples:
- "Get more leads by automating your follow-ups"
- "Build a six-figure agency by doing less client work"

**4. Helping Headline**
```
Helping [Audience] [Achieve Outcome]
```
Examples:
- "Helping SaaS founders scale without burnout"
- "Helping e-commerce brands double repeat purchases"

**5. Paradoxical Headline**
```
Like a [Familiar thing]. Unlike any [Familiar thing].
```
Examples:
- "Like an assistant. Unlike any assistant you've had."
- "Like hiring a developer. Without the hiring part."

### PAS Formula (Problem-Agitate-Solve)
Use for body copy, emails, and sales pages:

```
**Problem:** State the pain point they're experiencing
**Agitate:** Twist the knife—what happens if they don't fix it?
**Solve:** Present your solution as the answer
```

Example:
> **Problem:** You're spending 10+ hours a week on manual data entry.
> **Agitate:** That's 520 hours a year—13 full work weeks—wasted on tasks that should take minutes.
> **Solve:** Our automation handles it in under an hour. Get your 13 weeks back.

### AIDA Formula (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)
Classic persuasion structure:

```
**Attention:** Hook them with a bold claim or question
**Interest:** Explain why it matters to them
**Desire:** Show exactly what they'll get
**Action:** Tell them what to do next
```

---

## Value Proposition Frameworks

### The Value Prop Statement
Answer these questions in ONE sentence:
1. Who is your audience?
2. What problem do you solve?
3. How do you solve it differently?

**Template:**
```
[Product/Service] helps [Target Audience] [Achieve Outcome] by [Unique Method].
```

**Examples:**
- "Stripe is financial infrastructure for internet businesses to grow revenue."
- "We help roofing companies get more jobs with Google Ads that actually work."

### The Grunt Test (Donald Miller)
Can someone answer these in 5 seconds of looking at your page?
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make my life better?
3. How do I get it?

If they can't, simplify.

### Value Prop Sub-Elements

**Headline:** The main promise
**Subhead:** Clarifies who it's for and what they get
**CTA:** The immediate next step

Example structure:
```
[Headline] Build websites in hours, not weeks
[Subhead] The no-code platform for founders who want to launch fast
[CTA] Start building free
```

## CTA Best Practices

### The 5 Rules of High-Converting CTAs

1. **One CTA per page** — Multiple CTAs kill conversion rates
2. **Show what happens next** — "Get your free guide" beats "Submit"
3. **Use action verbs** — Start, Get, Join, Build, Claim, Discover
4. **Create urgency (when genuine)** — "Claim your spot" vs "Sign up anytime"
5. **Make it impossible to miss** — Contrast color, strategic placement

### CTA Power Verbs

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Getting started** | Start, Begin, Get, Try, Join |
| **Access** | Unlock, Access, Download, Claim |
| **Discovery** | Explore, Discover, See, Find |
| **Action** | Build, Create, Launch, Generate |
| **Commitment** | Reserve, Book, Schedule, Secure |

### CTA Formula: [Verb] + [Outcome/Time/Specifics]

| Weak CTA | Strong CTA |
|----------|------------|
| Submit | Get my free checklist |
| Learn more | See how it works in 2 minutes |
| Sign up | Start your free trial |
| Contact us | Book your 15-minute strategy call |
| Buy now | Get instant access |

### First-Person CTAs (Higher Conversions)

| Standard | First-Person |
|----------|--------------|
| Get started | Get me started |
| Start trial | Start my free trial |
| Download | Give me the guide |
| Claim offer | I want this deal |

## Landing Page Copy Structure

### The Hero → Problem → Solution → Proof → CTA Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  HERO SECTION                       │
│  - Headline: The main promise       │
│  - Subhead: Who it's for + outcome  │
│  - Primary CTA                      │
│  - Optional: Social proof strip     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROBLEM SECTION                    │
│  - Agitate the pain                 │
│  - Show you understand              │
│  - "You've tried X and Y..."        │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SOLUTION SECTION                   │
│  - Introduce your approach          │
│  - How it works (3-4 steps)         │
│  - Benefits (not just features)     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  PROOF SECTION                      │
│  - Testimonials with specifics      │
│  - Case studies / Results           │
│  - Trust badges / Logos             │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  FINAL CTA SECTION                  │
│  - Reiterate the outcome            │
│  - Remove risk (guarantee, free)    │
│  - Clear action button              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Section-by-Section Guidelines

**Hero:**
- Headline = Value prop
- Subhead = 1-2 lines max
- One primary CTA button

**Problem:**
- Use "you" language
- Be specific about symptoms
- Don't lecture—empathize

**Solution:**
- Features → Benefits (see conversion below)
- 3-4 key points maximum
- Use bullets, not paragraphs

**Proof:**
- Specific results ("doubled revenue" not "great results")
- Photo + name + company = credible
- Video testimonials > text testimonials

**CTA:**
- Repeat from hero
- Add risk reversal if possible
- Keep it visible (sticky on mobile)

### Features → Benefits Conversion

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| 24/7 support | Get help whenever you need it |
| Automated workflows | Save 10+ hours every week |
| Custom reports | See exactly what matters to you |
| Unlimited users | Your whole team, one price |

**The "So What?" Test:**
After every feature, ask "So what?" Keep going until you hit the real benefit.

## Pricing Psychology

### 1. Anchoring
The first price people see becomes their reference point.

**Application:**
- Always show a higher-priced option first
- Cross out original prices to show discounts
- Compare to a more expensive alternative ("Less than hiring a VA")

### 2. Decoy Effect
Add a middle option that makes your target option look better.

**Example:**
```
Basic:    $29/month (too limited)
Pro:      $79/month (the one you want them to pick)
Premium:  $149/month (makes Pro look reasonable)
```

The Pro tier exists to make Premium look expensive and Basic look too limited. Most pick the middle.

### 3. Urgency & Scarcity (When Genuine)

| Urgency Type | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| Time-based | "Offer ends Friday" |
| Quantity-based | "Only 5 spots left" |
| Access-based | "Next cohort starts March 1" |

**Warning:** Only use genuine scarcity. Fake urgency destroys trust.

### 4. Price Formatting

| Less Effective | More Effective |
|----------------|----------------|
| $1,000.00 | $997 |
| $10/month | 33¢/day |
| Annual: $1,200 | Annual: $100/month (billed annually) |

### 5. The "No-Brainer" Pricing Positioning

```
[Option A] Do nothing → Stay stuck with [problem]
[Option B] DIY → [High time cost], [common mistakes]
[Option C] Our solution → [Low time investment], [guaranteed result]
```

## Reddit-Specific Copy Rules

### r/forhire (Hiring / For Hire Posts)

**What Works:**
- Specific skill sets, not vague "I do everything"
- Rates or rate ranges upfront
- Portfolio links in comments (not post body)
- Proof of work (samples, case studies)
- Direct, no-fluff tone

**Format Template:**
```
[For Hire] [Your Role] - [Key Skill] - [Rate/Availability]

Headline options:
- "For Hire] Senior Web Developer - React, Node, AWS - $75/hr"
- "[For Hire] Freelance Writer - SaaS & Tech - 10¢/word"

Body:
- 2-3 sentences on what you do
- 1-2 specific results ("Increased client conversions by 40%")
- Availability (hours/week, timezone)
- Link to portfolio in comments

Do NOT:
- Post the same thing daily
- Be vague about skills
- Overpromise ("I can do anything!")
- Include contact info in post (use DMs)
```

### r/slavelabour (Lower-Cost Tasks/Gigs)

**What Works:**
- Be extremely specific about deliverables
- Clear pricing (fixed is better than hourly)
- Quick turnaround = more interest
- Sample work or proof you can do it

**Format Template:**
```
[TASK] [What you need done] - [Budget]

Example:
"[TASK] Need a simple logo for YouTube channel - $20"

Body:
- Exact deliverables required
- Deadline
- Payment method
- Any requirements (portfolio, experience level)
```

### General Reddit Copy Principles

1. **Read the room** — Each subreddit has its own culture
2. **No marketing speak** — Redditors hate corporate BS
3. **Value first** — Give before you ask
4. **Engage in comments** — Don't just post and ghost
5. **Timing matters** — Post during peak hours (US morning/evening)
6. **Karma matters** — New accounts with low karma get filtered

### Reddit Anti-Patterns (What Gets Downvoted)

- "DM me for details" without context
- Obvious self-promotion without value
- Copy-pasted responses
- Bait-and-switch pricing
- Overpromising results
