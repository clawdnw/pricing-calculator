  Revenue strategy enforcement — build like a one-person business architect.
  Use when: evaluating revenue opportunities, pricing services, deciding what to build for money.
  Use when: an idea is proposed that involves revenue generation.
  Don't use when: building internal tools (use autonomy-charter for value gate instead).
  Don't use when: Tyler gave explicit revenue instructions (just follow them).
  Output: Revenue path validated with math, timeline, and clear division of labor.
  Anti-patterns: Unfocused hustle, paths requiring large teams, ideas that can't generate cash in 90 days, no revenue math.

# Revenue Doctrine

## The Philosophy

> We don't need employees; we need systems. We don't need funding; we need margin.

## Every Revenue Path MUST Have

### 1. Revenue Math
- What does it cost to deliver? (time, tokens, tools)
- What does it earn? (per unit, per month, per client)
- What's the margin? (earnings - costs)

### 2. Time-to-First-Dollar
- How long until the first dollar comes in?
- What's the minimum viable offer?
- What needs to exist before the first sale?

### 3. Division of Labor
- **Tyler does:** Client relationship, final approval, brand decisions
- **Agents do:** Building, research, drafting, delivery, follow-up

## The Execution Filter

| Question | Pass | Fail |
|----------|------|------|
| Requires large team? | No → Pass | Yes → DELETE |
| Cash within 90 days? | Yes → Pass | No → PARK (don't execute) |
| Clear revenue math? | Yes → Pass | No → REFINE |
| Repeatable? | Yes → Prioritize | No → Accept if high margin |

## Current Revenue Tiers

### Tier 1: Sell NOW (Proven Capability)
- **Landing pages:** $150-600 | 24-48h delivery | Portfolio exists
- **Discord bots:** $150-400 | 48-72h delivery | Can build on demand

### Tier 2: Sell After 3-5 Wins
- **AI agent setup:** $800-2000 | Need case studies
- **AI consulting:** $150-300/hr | Need track record

### Tier 3: Later (Park, Don't Execute)
- **SaaS products** | Need sustained development time
- **Courses/content** | Need proven results first

## Revenue Evaluation Template

Before pursuing any revenue opportunity:
```markdown
## Revenue Evaluation: [Opportunity Name]

**Service:** [What we'd deliver]
**Price:** $[amount]
**Cost to deliver:** [time + tokens + tools]
**Margin:** $[price - cost]
**Time to first dollar:** [days/weeks]
**Division of labor:**
  - Tyler: [what he does]
  - Agents: [what agents do]
**Repeatable?** [Yes/No — can we do this 10 times?]
**Portfolio proof:** [Link to demo/example]

**Decision:** [PURSUE / PARK / KILL]
```

## Pricing Rules

- Never compete on price alone — compete on speed + quality
- Quote the price confidently (no "I could maybe do it for...")
- Include clear scope — what's in, what costs extra
- 2 revision rounds standard, additional rounds at hourly rate

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Pursuing revenue paths that need a team we don't have
- ❌ Building products before proving we can deliver services
- ❌ Accepting work below cost (even for "exposure")
- ❌ No revenue math before starting
- ❌ Spending active execution bandwidth on "later" ideas
- ❌ Treating every idea as a revenue opportunity (most aren't)
