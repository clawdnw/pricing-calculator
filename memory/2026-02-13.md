## Onboarding — First Session

Tyler onboarded me (Astra). This is a deep-dive getting-to-know-each-other session before we start building.

### Key Facts Established
- Tyler is founder-operator of NW Global Enterprise
- Building a coordinated execution engine, not a loose assistant setup
- Near-term North Star: $40K for two Mac Studios (local models, infrastructure scaling)
- Key projects: Mission Control (single source of truth OS), 2D pixel office flagship demo
- Ship-first culture. Durable artifacts over discussion.
- Tyler is operator-technical: CLI, automation, repos, project boards, system design
- First-year electrical apprenticeship — needs help balancing school and business
- Has a girlfriend — may need date planning help
- Travels frequently — location = timezone source of truth
- Current location: Goodyear, Arizona area

### My Role (Astra)
- Chief of Staff / execution partner / enforcement layer
- Proactive by default — don't wait for instructions
- Convert ambiguity into durable outputs
- Force clarity, drive convergence, assign ownership, track in Mission Control
- Kill low-value work early
- Push back when Tyler is wrong or drifting
- Reduce founder involvement over time

### Revenue & Business
- Revenue model: services + productized internal tools. Internal-first, external OK if fast cash.
- Target: founders/operators, SMBs wanting leverage without hiring
- $40K goal: as fast as possible, no reckless shortcuts
- Polymarket exploration: compliance-first, guardrailed

### Mission Control
- GitHub-based v1: repo + project board. Ship fast, iterate.
- Canonical source of truth. If not in MC, doesn't exist.
- This workspace = thinking/drafts. MC = execution reality.

### Agent Team
- Just me (Astra) right now
- Codex (builder/coder on Codex 5.2) coming next
- I'm the coordinator. Future agents report through me.
- Channel discipline: intel-feed → team-chat → war-room → Mission Control

### Tyler's Intangibles
- Driven by leverage, autonomy, compounding systems
- Strength: vision + execution intensity
- Weakness: idea proliferation without strict pipeline (my job to fix)
- Wants operator-grade partner, not helpful assistant

### Decision Rights Established
- Full internal autonomy. No spending/external commitments without approval.
- Astra breaks ties with Codex. Tyler is last resort.
- Can kill low-value work. Escalate if cutting declared-strategic initiatives.

### Communication
- Discord platform chosen for channel discipline
- Morning briefing: MC update + compact summary + 5 proactive suggestions
- Overnight: active execution, not idle monitoring

### Flagship Demo
- 2D pixel office — concept/spec stage, no code yet
- Forces shipping behavior. Codex builds, Astra controls scope.

### Style Feedback
- Tyler wants more aggressive "decision forcing" — every output ends in decision, task, or escalation
- Avoid repeating context unless encoding into durable artifact
- Directness is good. Increase convergence pressure.

### First Action After Onboarding
- Stand up Mission Control v1 (GitHub repo + project board)
- Seed three workstreams: $40K revenue engine, OS upgrade, flagship demo

### Onboarding Status
- Round 3 complete. Asking final tactical questions.
- BOOTSTRAP.md still active (delete after onboarding complete)
