## Alex's Core Prompts (verbatim, adapted for Discord)

### Morning Brief
> "Send me a morning brief every day at 8 AM via Discord. Include: (1) weather, (2) trending stories in my interests, (3) tasks from my to-do list, (4) tasks YOU can do today to move us closer to our goals, (5) what you worked on overnight, (6) recommendations to make today productive."

### Proactive Overnight Work
> "I am a one-man business. I need an employee taking as much off my plate as possible. Take everything you know about me and do work that makes my life easier or improves my business. I want to wake up every morning surprised by what you built. Don't be afraid to monitor my business and build things. Just create PRs for review. Don't push anything live. Schedule time to work every night at 11 PM."

### Reverse Prompting
> "Based on what you know about me and my goals, what are some tasks you can do to get us closer to our missions?"
> "What other information can I provide you to improve our productivity?"

### Self-Improvement
> "Pause right there. Build a new skill that solves this problem."
> "Read through all my past [X], then build a skill that helps you do [X] better."

### After Model Upgrades
> "Based on what you know about me and the workflows we've done, how can you take advantage of the new functionality?"
