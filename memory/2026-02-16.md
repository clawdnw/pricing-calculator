## Self-Optimization Pass

Tyler requested full workspace audit and optimization — make everything structured for 24/7 autonomous operation.

### Changes Made
- **BOOTSTRAP.md deleted** — onboarding complete, no longer needed
- **MEMORY.md rewritten** — 12KB → 2.2KB. Aggressive prune. Stable facts only, everything else referenced via file paths. Target was <4K tokens.
- **HEARTBEAT.md populated** — real periodic checks: email, calendar, GitHub, MC, QMD index. Rotation-based (2-3 per beat), with quiet hours and staleness tracking.
- **heartbeat-state.json created** — tracks last-run timestamps for each check category
- **Cron: qmd-index-refresh** — runs every 2h, keeps workspace search index fresh
- **Dead cron (overnight-prep) removed** — was one-shot, already ran, had delivery error
- **Daily file created** (this file)

### Overnight Research Delivered
- Fixed-scope service offers ranked (landing pages + bots recommended first)
- QMD confirmed working, vector search deferred to Mac Studios
- Persistent memory: no new tools needed, file hygiene is the bottleneck
- Full writeup: memory/overnight-research-2026-02-16.md

### Workspace Audit Results
- gog CLI: authenticated, Gmail + Calendar working (clawdnw@gmail.com)
- GitHub CLI: authenticated as clawdnw, NW-Global-Enterprise org active
- Discord: connected, channels set up
- Codex CLI: installed at expected path
- QMD: installed and working (BM25 search)
- Tools available: gog, himalaya, memo, remindctl, gh
- **Gap found:** Brave Search API key not configured — web_search tool fails

## Alex Finn Video Analysis

Analyzed all 6 videos (~130 min total) by Alex Finn about OpenClaw and his agent Henry.

### What I Implemented
- **SOUL.md rewritten** — Added proactive employee mindset, reverse prompting habit, self-improvement loop, overnight work ethic, personality emphasis
- **Morning Brief cron** (8 AM daily) — Weather, email, calendar, GitHub, proactive task suggestions → Discord #general
- **Nightly Autonomous Work cron** (11 PM daily) — Silent work session: service prep, MC updates, research, memory maintenance
- **Afternoon Research cron** (2 PM daily) — Rotating deep-dive research → Discord #general summary
- **Brain/Muscle architecture** — Documented in TOOLS.md: Opus thinks, muscles (Codex/QMD/gog/summarize) execute
- **Last30Days skill installed** — Reddit/X trend research (from Matt Van Horn, referenced in videos 2 & 5)
- **Second brain folders** — Created memory/ideas, memory/research, memory/drafts for structured capture
- **HEARTBEAT.md upgraded** — Added proactive work items, not just monitoring checks

### What Still Needs Tyler's Input
- Brave Search API key (needed for web_search tool and research crons)
- xAI/Grok API key (needed for X/Twitter research via last30days skill)
- To-do app choice (Things 3? Apple Reminders? Something else?)
- Second brain web UI (needs Codex CLI to build — ready when Tyler says go)

### Key Insights from Alex
- Biggest differentiator isn't technical — it's treating the agent as a real employee
- Reverse prompting is the #1 force multiplier
- Self-improvement loop: when something fails, build a skill
- Overnight autonomous work is where compound value happens
- Brain/muscle architecture saves massive token costs
