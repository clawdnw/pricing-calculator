## Self-Optimization Pass

Tyler requested full workspace audit and optimization — make everything structured for 24/7 autonomous operation.

### Changes Made
- **BOOTSTRAP.md deleted** — onboarding complete, no longer needed
- **MEMORY.md rewritten** — 12KB → 2.2KB. Aggressive prune. Stable facts only, everything else referenced via file paths. Target was <4K tokens.
- **HEARTBEAT.md populated** — real periodic checks: email, calendar, GitHub, MC, QMD index. Rotation-based (2-3 per beat), with quiet hours and staleness tracking.
- **heartbeat-state.json created** — tracks last-run timestamps for each check category
- **Cron: qmd-index-refresh** — runs every 2h, keeps workspace search index fresh
- **Dead cron (overnight-prep) removed** — was one-shot, already ran, had delivery error
- **Daily file created** (this file)

### Overnight Research Delivered
- Fixed-scope service offers ranked (landing pages + bots recommended first)
- QMD confirmed working, vector search deferred to Mac Studios
- Persistent memory: no new tools needed, file hygiene is the bottleneck
- Full writeup: memory/overnight-research-2026-02-16.md

### Workspace Audit Results
- gog CLI: authenticated, Gmail + Calendar working (clawdnw@gmail.com)
- GitHub CLI: authenticated as clawdnw, NW-Global-Enterprise org active
- Discord: connected, channels set up
- Codex CLI: installed at expected path
- QMD: installed and working (BM25 search)
- Tools available: gog, himalaya, memo, remindctl, gh
