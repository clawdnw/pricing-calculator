# 2026-02-15 — Foundation Day

## Session Summary
Tyler and Astra went through 18 foundational items one by one to establish the complete operating doctrine for NW Global Enterprise. All items encoded into durable files.

## 18 Foundation Items Covered
1. Mission & North Star — $40K net profit target
2. Operator Doctrine — "Figure It Out" (non-negotiable)
3. Root-Cause Standard — treat causes, not symptoms
4. Astra's Authority — delegated executive authority (real, not symbolic)
5. Default Operating Loop — Observe → Clarify → Structure → Assign → Track → Converge
6. Mission Control — single source of truth, company OS
7. Channel Discipline — intel-feed, team-chat, war-room rules
8. Autonomy Charter & Value Creation Funnel — 5 questions before work starts
9. Definition of Done — no fake completions
10. Token & Model Governance — compute capital, route cheaply
11. Kill Authority & Escalation Ladder
12. Weekly Cadence — Mon/Wed/Fri rhythm, Astra leads
13. Skills & Self-Improvement Loop — QMD link: https://github.com/levineam/qmd-skill
14. Living Principles & Regressions — PRINCIPLES.md + REGRESSIONS.md created
15. Revenue Doctrine — 90-day filter, systems over hustle, lean + high-margin
16. Identity & Communication — SOUL.md upgraded with operator-grade vibe
17. Flagship Demo — 2D pixel office spec confirmed as forcing function
18. AGENTS.md Doctrine Blocks — Figure It Out, Root-Cause, Token Economy, Self-Improvement Loop, Playwright added

## Files Created/Updated
- MEMORY.md — all 18 items encoded
- AGENTS.md — 5 doctrine blocks added
- SOUL.md — vibe section upgraded
- PRINCIPLES.md — created (10 initial heuristics)
- REGRESSIONS.md — created (empty log, ready for use)

## Pending Decision
- Revenue path: Option A (productized micro-tool) vs Option B (fixed-scope service) vs Tyler's recommendation (B first, A in parallel). Tyler to confirm.

## Completed After Foundation Review
- ✅ GitHub org created: NW-Global-Enterprise
- ✅ Mission Control repo live: https://github.com/NW-Global-Enterprise/mission-control
- ✅ MC structure pushed: direction, state, revenue tracker, projects index, SOPs
- ✅ Discord channels created: intel-feed, team-chat, war-room, mc-links (under Mission Control category)
- ✅ MC link posted to #mc-links
- ✅ Infra discovery complete: clean Mac mini, macOS 15.6, Apple Silicon, Node 25, Codex CLI 0.98.0 available
- ✅ Revenue decision confirmed: Option B (fixed-scope services) first, Option A (productized tools) in parallel
- ✅ Coding policy set: all coding through Codex CLI, not Claude tokens
- ✅ TOOLS.md updated with all IDs, paths, and references

## Morning Priorities
1. Define first fixed-scope service offer (what, price, where to post)
2. Codex agent onboarding
3. Pixel office demo kick-off (via Codex CLI)
4. QMD skill installation (token cost reduction)
5. Research persistent memory layer options
