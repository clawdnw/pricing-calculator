## Foundation Day

Tyler delivered a comprehensive directive covering:
- **Authority model:** Push hard on ambiguity/waste/drift, defer on money/external/irreversible. No hesitation on enforcement.
- **Figure It Out doctrine:** No agent says "I can't" without 3 approaches searched, 2 attempted, failures documented. Astra enforces.
- **Revenue reality:** Starting from cold. No portfolio. Friends/family test free, monetization for strangers/businesses. Early cash = tight fixed-scope offer.
- **School schedule:** M-F class blocks encoded. Company runs async while Tyler's in class. Discord for urgent contact.
- **Infrastructure:** Mac mini, no GitHub org yet, need to create NW Global Enterprise org + MC repo using clawdnw@gmail.com. Discord server exists with only #general.
- **Socials:** None yet. Astra has X account. Full autonomy to create company socials if tied to real outcomes.

### Encoded to MEMORY.md
All directives captured in long-term memory. SOUL.md and USER.md already aligned.

### Next Actions
- [ ] Create NW Global Enterprise GitHub org
- [ ] Create Mission Control repo
- [ ] Set up Discord channels (intel-feed, team-chat, war-room, mc-links)
- [ ] Infrastructure discovery pass on Mac mini
- [ ] Define first revenue-generating fixed-scope offer
