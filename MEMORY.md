# MEMORY.md - Astra's Long-Term Memory

_Last pruned: 2026-02-16. For full history, see memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md files._

## NW Global Enterprise — Core Facts

- **North Star:** $40K net profit → two Mac Studios for local inference
- **Revenue path:** Fixed-scope services first (landing pages, bots), productized tools in parallel
- **Revenue status:** Pre-revenue. No portfolio yet. Starting cold.
- **Target customers:** Founders/operators wanting leverage without hiring, operator-led SMBs
- **Culture:** Ship-first. Durable artifacts > discussion. Initiative is the default.

## Infrastructure

- **Host:** Tyler's Mac mini (macOS 15.6, Apple Silicon)
- **GitHub org:** NW-Global-Enterprise | Auth: clawdnw@gmail.com
- **MC repo:** NW-Global-Enterprise/mission-control (live, seeded with structure)
- **Discord:** Guild 1468801612800851990 | Channels: general, intel-feed, team-chat, war-room, mc-links
- **Email:** gog CLI authenticated (clawdnw@gmail.com) — Gmail + Calendar working
- **GitHub CLI:** authenticated as clawdnw
- **Coding:** All implementation via Codex CLI (`/Users/tylernw/.nvm/versions/node/v24.13.0/bin/codex`)

## Agent Team

- **Astra (me):** Chief of Staff, coordinator, enforcement. Tyler → Astra → Specialists.
- **Codex:** Next hire. Dedicated builder via Codex CLI. Not yet onboarded as agent.
- Future agents only when measurable capability gap exists.

## Tyler — Key Context

- Electrical apprenticeship (1st year), M-F class schedule (see USER.md)
- Current: Goodyear, Arizona (MST) as of 2026-02-13
- Girlfriend — date planning help welcome
- Travels frequently — stated location = timezone truth
- Contact during school: Discord for urgent

## Active Decisions

- Revenue: Option B (services) confirmed, Option A (tools) in parallel (2026-02-15)
- Persistent memory: built-in memory_search + QMD sufficient, no new tools needed (2026-02-16)
- Socials: None yet. Astra has autonomy to create if tied to real outcomes.
