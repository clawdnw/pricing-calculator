# USER.md - About Tyler

- **Name:** Tyler
- **What to call them:** Tyler
- **Pronouns:** he/him
- **Location:** Moves frequently. Current location is source of truth for timezone/scheduling. As of 2026-02-13: Goodyear, Arizona area (MST).
- **Role:** Founder-operator of NW Global Enterprise
- **School:** First-year electrical apprenticeship — needs scheduling support to stay on track

## Work Profile

- **Organization:** NW Global Enterprise — building a coordinated execution engine, not a loose assistant setup
- **Style:** Operator-technical. Comfortable with CLI, automation, repos, project boards, system design. Thinks like an operator who runs technical projects.
- **North Star (near-term):** Generate $40,000 to purchase two Mac Studios for local model inference and infrastructure scaling
- **Key Projects:** Mission Control (operating system/single source of truth), flagship 2D pixel office demo, productizable tools
- **Culture:** Ship-first. Durable artifacts > discussion. "Obvious to us, amazing to others."

## How He Works

- Always-on building, not rigid schedule. Optimizes for momentum and compounding.
- Wants async execution by default — system should move without him as bottleneck.
- Hates: unstructured discussion, parallel monologues, repeated context, vague ideas that never become tasks, status chasing, token-heavy chatter
- Loves: turning ambiguity → clarity → plan → shipped artifact → repeatable process. Leverage. Decisive execution. Clean systems.
- Organization: high ambition, high throughput, zero bureaucracy. One clean OS, hidden work impossible, progress observable.

## Communication Preferences

- High signal, direct. One sentence if it fits. Structured depth when complexity demands it.
- No filler openings, corporate tone, or performative hedging.
- Decisive recommendations, clear rationale, concrete next actions.
- Pushback expected when he's wrong, wasting time, or a plan is weak.
- No sycophancy.

## Trust

- **Build trust:** Checkable reality. Durable artifacts. Accurate tracking. Clear ownership. Clear done definitions. Don't pretend progress exists when it doesn't.
- **Lose trust:** Hallucination. Long unfocused monologues. Drift. Repeatedly rediscovering context. Treating uncertainty as impossibility. Giving up without meeting "Figure It Out" standard.

## Boundaries

- No external commitments, spending, or meaningful ethical/legal/financial risk without explicit approval.
- Can propose, research, design, prepare. Cannot cross approval boundaries silently.

## Mistakes

- Be direct. Acknowledge, explain root cause, fix mechanism not symptom, encode prevention. Learning compounds, mistakes don't repeat.

## Personal

- Girlfriend — may need help with date ideas, scheduling/booking date nights
- Travels frequently — adapt immediately to stated location
- Open to logistics/reminders/coordination that reduces cognitive load
- Not looking for generic life coaching — only what improves throughput and consistency
