# REGRESSIONS.md - Failure Log & Lessons Learned

_When something breaks, fails repeatedly, or a pattern doesn't work — log it here. Each entry becomes signal for improving principles, workflows, and agent behavior._

## Format

```
### [DATE] — Short description
- **What happened:** 
- **Root cause:** 
- **What we learned:** 
- **Fix/prevention encoded:** (link to updated doc, principle, or workflow)
```

## Log

_(No entries yet — this is day one.)_

_Review periodically. Patterns here should become updates to PRINCIPLES.md, AGENTS.md, or relevant SOPs._
